          <h2>Want to learn to code?</h2>
          <p>This summer camp is meant to be a fun easy introduction to coding for students in Bend, Oregon.
            Throughout the four days of camp, we will be using multiple coding apps and educational
            tools that will teach kids the fundamentals of coding. All of
            the necessary technology will be provided. Camps take place from Monday
            through Thursday. Half way through each camp there
            will be an included snack. If you have any other questions about the
            schedule, please don't hesitate to email us at
            <a href="mailto:1chasemcd@gmail.com">1chasemcd@gmail.com</a>.</p>

          <h2>Chase</h2>
          <p>I am a Sophomore at Summit High School. I have taken classes on
            computer science, and have made online tutorials for coding. I have
            also participated on Summit's robotics team, where I work with a team
            to program robots. I know the programing languages Java,
            Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many others. I also designed this
            website using HTML and CSS. I am very excited to share my interest
            in computer science with other kids.

          <p>I am an eighth grader at Cascade middle school. Chase is my older
            brother, and he has taught me a lot about coding. When I was younger,
            I used an app called Hopscotch to learn to code. I was always proud
            when I was able to start from scratch and make a computer draw
            something, or make a stick figure move. I had lots of help from my
            older brother. With this creation of this camp, I am hopeful that
            other children will have this same experience and be able to enjoy
            coding!</p>

          <h2>Intro to Programming</h2>
          <p>In this program, Bend, Oregon students grades 2 to 5 will gain basic knowledge on
            coding. We will start by using a simple language called Scratch to
            learn about the basic tools of coding. Scratch uses
            colorful blocks of code that can be used together to create games.
            This will teach the concepts involved in all programing languages,
            while avoiding the complex syntax used in written programming
            languages like Java and Python. After kids learn the basics of
            programming, they will use their new skills to program robots such as
            spheros, Lego Mindstorms robots, and more!</p>

          <h2>Code Camp 2</h2>
          <p>In our second offered program, Bend, Oregon students grades 3 to 6 will have the opportunity
             to build off of what they learned in the previous program. We will start
             by reviewing what was learned in the introductory course, then jump right
             back into programming with the language Scratch. This time, kids will learn
             more advanced skill to use when making fun games. All of the skills
             learned using this language will then be applied to programming robots,
             such as Lego Mindstorms and spheros, which both provide a fun way to use
             computer skills. This more advanced camp will be a blast for kids that
          love to code!</p>
